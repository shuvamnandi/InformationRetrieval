Wales have been a breath of fresh air at this championship, a side back at a major finals for the first time since 1958 having excelled on the pitch while their magnificent support chorused them gloriously from the stands. They missed the banned Aaron Ramseys composure and creation here but, even so, it took a phenomenon in Cristiano Ronaldo to break them. Gareth Bale and Ramsey have played their stellar roles but there have been outstanding performers throughout the squad from James Chester at the back, through the bearded Joe Ledley in midfield \u2013 it is staggering to consider he broke his leg in early May \u2013 and the clubless but tireless Hal Robson-Kanu up front. We cant come off with any regrets, said Chris Coleman before kick-off. Even in defeat, they should return home with none.", "id": "football/2016/jul/06/portugal-wales-five-talking-points", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "This was to be Ronaldos night. An evening which had begun with a smile and a hug for an opportunist teenager gatecrashing Portugals team photograph quickly descended into the usual arm-flinging frustration and incensed whinging at the referee. Ronaldo seems to have to whip himself up into a stroppy frenzy to find some form and, from the moment Ashley Williams was not penalised for a foul on the forward three minutes in, he was berating anyone who would listen. James Collins, in for the suspended Ben Davies, actually dealt with him well for long periods but Ronaldo, in amid the petulant playacting, was merely waiting for his moment. The leap above James Chester and thumped header which forced Portugal ahead early in the second half was glorious, his assist for Nanis second rather more fortunate. Yet, on each occasion, the manic celebrations ensured the world knew who had stamped his name on the tournament. These can still be his finals.", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "type": "article", "webPublicationDate": "2016-07-06T21:02:59Z", "webTitle": "Portugal 2-0 Wales: five talking points from the semi-final in Lyon", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/06/portugal-wales-five-talking-points", "wordCnt": 837}, {"apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2016/jul/06/cymru-v-portiwgal-yn-fyw", "firPara": "Reit, maer wifi yn terrible fan hyn, so mae rhaid i mi logio bant nawr.
