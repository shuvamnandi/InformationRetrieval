More so than its FA Cup counterpart, the League Cup final has been notable for quite a few turnaround victories, ever since Rotherham United let a 2-0 first-leg lead slip against Aston Villa in the very first decider back in 1961. Other famous comeback wins include QPRs effort from two goals down against West Brom in 1967; Liverpool hauling themselves back at the death against Spurs in 1982; Arsenal breaking Sheffield Wednesday hearts (and their own collarbones) in 1993; and Jos\u00e9 Mourinhos Chelsea shushing Liverpool in 2005. First blood in these fixtures doesnt always count in the last ten years, five of the finals have been won by the team conceding first. (Chelsea v Arsenal in 2007, Spurs v Chelsea in 2008, Manchester United v Aston Villa in 2010, Liverpool v Cardiff in 2012, Manchester City v Sunderland in 2014.) So our advice to Saints and United this weekend? Enjoy Wembley. But if you go one up early doors, for goodness sake keep your counsel.
