Even in victory this was an anticlimactic mish-mash. The crowd did not necessarily demand a rip-roaring send-off before the teams departure for France but they were dismayed by the awkward nature of Englands approach. Roy Hodgson might point to promise in his tactical tweaks but it was not always easy to discern much logical pattern to his teams approach. For long periods five of the outfield players were effectively being used out of position, if Chris Smallings employment as a left-sided centre-half is taken into account. Formations dont win you games, Hodgson had said but surely a level of familiarity in approach may have helped nine days from their opening Euro 2016 Group B fixture.", "id": "football/blog/2016/jun/02/england-portugal-euro-2016-five-things", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "Hodgson has fiddled with his formation over these friendly fixtures and appears to have concluded Danny Welbecks absence rather nullifies the 4-3-3, leaving his team built around the diamond. Yet whether the combination who started this contest should be deployed is open to doubt. Wayne Rooney sat at the tip \u2013 he had never played with Jamie Vardy before \u2013 though his eagerness to break beyond Danilo split the strikers and pinned them to the flanks. Harry Kane felt wasted out there, forever a raking pass away from his club-mate Dele Alli, where their close combination play had previously felt so key. The influence of the two most prolific English forwards in the Premier League felt unnecessarily blunted.
