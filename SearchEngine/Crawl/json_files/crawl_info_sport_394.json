Saints have won three and lost just one of their past six encounters against Arsenal in all competitions and a maiden win for Claude Puel in this match would give Gooners something new to wail and gnash over following a reasonably satisfactory summer spending spree which saw a central defender, central midfielder and forward, for whom fans have been crying out so vocally, added to the Emirates payroll. How Shkodran Mustafi, Granit Xhaka and Lucas P\u00e9rez will fare in their first Premier League season remains to be seen and we should get our first sight of the German stopper if, as expected, he makes his debut in place of Rob Holding alongside Laurent Koscielny in the heart of Arsenals defence. P\u00e9rez is likely to start Saturdays match on the bench, but will not stay on it for long if Olivier Giroud fails to improve on his reasonable but unremarkable return of less than one goal every two games in Arsenal colours. With so many pieces of his puzzle now in place, one cant help but feel Arsenal could be just one prolific striker away from winning that elusive league title their supporters crave. No pressure, Lucas.
