That theyve not won this game is absurd. They were vastly superior to the Czechs for long periods, led by two goals and looked like they were going to win by a handsome margin. They werent the same side when Luka Modric went off, though, and the Czechs fought back thanks to two substitutes, meaning that theyre still alive. Theyll probably go through if they beat Turkey in their final game. The main talking point, though, is the lengthy stoppage caused by the antics of the Croatia fans, who chucked several flares on to the pitch near the end before fights broke out in their section. It all leaves a sour taste in the mouth. To quote Gary Lineker, Croatian flares overshadowed Croatian flair. There will be repercussions. Thanks for reading and emailing.
