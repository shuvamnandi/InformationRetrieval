When organised sport is introduced at about the age of eight, many hildren born earlier in the year will be bigger, stronger and faster than their younger classmates.

By the time they reach an age where the physical difference has evened out, they are better players, and it is difficult for others to close the gap. Many potentially great players born at the wrong time of year are lost to elite sport.
