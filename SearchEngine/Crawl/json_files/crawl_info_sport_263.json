Some of them feel that their team specifically would not be supportive, he said. Not their team-mates, but the coaches, the club and the administration around them. They either know them to be openly hostile, having stood in conversations or having overheard conversations that were incontrovertible, or suspected it. It is interesting how many of them I know are out to a greater or lesser extent to their family, friends and a selection of their team-mates. Its amazing to me that people dont realise that there are lots of players whose manager picks them up after training \u2013 and that cant always be the case.", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "type": "article", "webPublicationDate": "2016-11-08T17:27:27Z", "webTitle": "Gay Premier League players are scared to come out, John Amaechi tells MPs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/08/english-football-tolerates-homophobia-john-amaechi-tells-mps", "wordCnt": 796}, {"apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2016/nov/08/uefa-womens-euro-2017-finals-draw-live", "firPara": "So there you have it, short and very sweet.
