The story of Robert Pir\u00e8s starting with a watching brief as Arsenal met Sunderland in the kind of attritional battle that looked to the new man like a horror show remains an instructive one. Against Southampton the striker Lucas P\u00e9rez and the defender Shkodran Mustafi were plonked straight into a tense Premier League encounter and looked \u2013 perhaps understandably \u2013 a little offbeat. Wenger reflected that both had some nerves and were short of match fitness, as well as the obvious sense that partnerships have had no time to gel yet. Wenger is pleading for patience as they settle in. Mustafi looked small for a centre-back and hesitant at times. Lucas was eager, got an assist but was not sharp enough to make a significant impact. Lets not judge too quickly, Wenger said. Lets give them time. It was interesting, with that in mind, to see the third member of Arsenals major summer newcomers band on the bench. Granit Xhaka had been praised for his impressive show at Watford last time out but was left out against Southampton as the old partnership of Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin excelled. The balance between the two, blending Cazorlas trickery with Coquelins tackles, seemed natural as the pair played increasingly important roles as the game went on. Wenger will probably feel compelled to play Mustafi regularly, with the Germany international having to adapt through game time given the centre-back injury situation. But with more options in midfield and up front, Xhaka and Lucas can expect to be rotated in and out as the Arsenal manager looks for his strongest team.
