Gary Neville, sitting beside the outgoing manager, tendered his own resignation here. Gareth Southgate, some bookies favourite for the role, cannot simply lean on success in the Toulon Under-21 tournament earlier this summer as reason to be given the job. Dan Ashworth, the FAs director of elite development, may have to look abroad for a successor of any real weight, though England have been down that road before, and memories of Fabio Capello linger. Hodgson spoke of promise and progress and he did bring through younger players into the setup. Whoever his successor turns out to be has a promising squad with which to work. But recovering from this humiliation may take some time.", "id": "football/blog/2016/jun/27/england-iceland-roy-hodgson-euro-2016-five-talking-points", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "Given he had arrived in France with such a young squad, Hodgson had been utterly dependent on his more experienced personnel to guide the juniors through. Such as Harry Kane \u2013 who appeared mentally exhausted as if two years of non-stop industry had caught up with him \u2013 Dele Alli and Eric Dier needed to be reassured by the older heads around them. For a while Wayne Rooney had suggested he would do just that. Yet he was steadily eclipsed here, his passing lacking its usual zest, and when England needed leadership this team merely looked confused and befuddled. His substitution before the end was telling. The same could be said of Joe Hart, who has twice been beaten down low to his left in this tournament, by Gareth Bale from distance and now Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, with the ball slipping through his grasp. On both occasions he knew he should have done better. Hodgson had needed his most established players to excel if the team were going to make an impression. In the end they simply wilted like the rest.", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "type": "article", "webPublicationDate": "2016-06-27T22:25:39Z", "webTitle": "England 1-2 Iceland: five talking points from the Euro 2016 last-16 tie | Dominic Fifield", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/27/england-iceland-roy-hodgson-euro-2016-five-talking-points", "wordCnt": 840}, {"apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2016/jun/27/england-1-2-iceland-euro-2016-player-ratings-for-last-16-knockout-game", "firPara": "England were humiliated after a mistake from Joe Hart and defensive lapses, but Icelands Ragnar Sigurdsson, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Kari Arnason were magnificent", "id": "football/2016/jun/27/england-1-2-iceland-euro-2016-player-ratings-for-last-16-knockout-game", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "England were humiliated after a mistake from Joe Hart and defensive lapses, but Icelands Ragnar Sigurdsson, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Kari Arnason were magnificent", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "type": "article", "webPublicationDate": "2016-06-27T21:52:06Z", "webTitle": "England 1-2 Iceland: Euro 2016 player ratings for last-16 knockout game", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/27/england-1-2-iceland-euro-2016-player-ratings-for-last-16-knockout-game", "wordCnt": 701}, {"apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2016/jun/27/iceland-england-euro-2016-triumph", "firPara": "Iceland had a plan and they followed it so well that England were left perplexed and dispatched from the European Championshi", "id": "football/blog/2016/jun/27/iceland-england-euro-2016-triumph", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "Takk fyrir Island.
