That was a hard scenario to imagine when Pep Guardiolas remodelled side burst out of the blocks with 10 wins on the spin. Two draws and two defeats later, City face Claude Puels Southampton, who have the leagues third-best defence. They will probably have the weekends heaviest legs too, given their energy-sapping trip to Italy to face Internazionale, who narrowly beat them on Thursday. With City having scored just once in their past three matches and Guardiola opting to play Sergio Ag\u00fcero for only 10 minutes of the managers unhappy return to Barcelona, surely the temptation to tease a reaction out of him with a start at the Etihad Stadium is too great to resist. For once it feels like the recently hamstrung Argentinian has been handled with a little too much care, and he will be highly motivated to show Guardiola that he neednt have been so cautious with him at the Camp Nou.
