Which is to say that it has never been easier to succeed, which is to say that England stand on the verge of opportunity. Though they do not have top-level players in every position and though they do not have any world stars, yet few countries have as deep a selection nor as wide an array of attacking talent.", "id": "football/blog/2016/nov/14/world-cup-2018-qualifiers-10-talking-points", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "The question, then, is whether Gareth Southgate is the man to extract the maximum from it.
