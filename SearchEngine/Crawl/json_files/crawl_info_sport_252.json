Mannones injury, however, has given the 22-year-old a steady run in the first team and he has grasped\u00a0his\u00a0opportunity as convincingly\u00a0as he claims crosses. Despite committing a costly blunder against Southampton in his first outing of the season, he has been one of Sunderlands most reliable performers even when left obscenely exposed by his defence. His saves were a big factor in his clubs first Premier League win of the season against Bournemouth and his performance at White Hart Lane in September, when Hugo Lloris hailed him as amazing, was the main reason Sunderland escaped with only a narrow defeat.

He would have been farmed out again if Antonio Conte had not thought his potential could finally be harnessed at Chelsea four years after the club originally signed him. In October the Italian switched formation and used Moses as a wing-back for the game against Hull City, giving the Nigeria international his first league start for Chelsea in 1,239 days.
