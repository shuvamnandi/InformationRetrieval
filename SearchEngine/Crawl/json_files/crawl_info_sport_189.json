The fracas in stoppage time at Manchester City this month prompted charges last week for both clubs from the Football Association, and a fifth in 19 months for the Premier League leaders for the same offence. But are the London club likely to become the first sanctioned in this way since Arsenal and Manchester United had two points and one point removed respectively back in 1990?", "id": "football/2016/dec/12/chelsea-face-threat-of-a-premier-league-points-deduction-an-explanation", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "The game at the Etihad Stadium had crept into stoppage time at the end with Chelsea 3-1 up when Sergio Ag\u00fceros heavy touch was followed by a horribly wild leap into David Luiz, the forward making contact with the Brazilians right leg. The challenge would prompt a red card for the striker but before it was shown by the referee Anthony Taylor, Ag\u00fcero was pushed to the ground by the Chelsea substitute Nathaniel Chalobah. There followed a melee in front of the dug-outs, while David Luiz remained on the turf, involving most of the players on the pitch as well as unused substitutes and coaching staff from each bench. Although some of those involved appeared to be attempting to restore order, the City midfielder Fernandinho was sent off for grabbing Cesc F\u00e0bregas by the neck and pushing him over the advertising hoarding.", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "type": "article", "webPublicationDate": "2016-12-12T12:34:21Z", "webTitle": "Why Chelsea face the threat of a Premier League points deduction | Dominic Fifield", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/12/chelsea-face-threat-of-a-premier-league-points-deduction-an-explanation", "wordCnt": 1190}, {"apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2016/dec/12/champions-league-last-16-your-club-knockout-stages", "firPara": "Are you happy with the last-16 draw and do you think your team will progress?", "id": "football/2016/dec/12/champions-league-last-16-your-club-knockout-stages", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "\u2022 Poll which clubs will qualify for the quarter-finals?", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "type": "article", "webPublicationDate": "2016-12-12T12:11:42Z", "webTitle": "Champions League last-16: how will your club fare in the knockout stages?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/12/champions-league-last-16-your-club-knockout-stages", "wordCnt": 156}, {"apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2016/dec/12/marounae-fellaini-can-deal-with-being-booed-by-manchester-united-fans-insists-phil-jones", "firPara": "Phil Jones has no concerns regarding Marouane Fellainis ability to deal with being booed by Manchester United supporters, as was the case when he was warming up during Sundays 1-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur.", "id": "football/2016/dec/12/marounae-fellaini-can-deal-with-being-booed-by-manchester-united-fans-insists-phil-jones", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "The Belgian received the jeers as he did some loosening exercises along the touchline at Old Trafford.
