Cesc F\u00e0bregas has become a recurring theme in the Italians post-match media briefings, whether he has been explaining the playmakers omission from the side, praising his professionalism in striving for a recall or hailing his impact from the bench. We all know Cesc is a great player with a great technique, he had said after the victory at Watford on Saturday, always with a good pass or assist. The interception and first-time delivery, scything between backtracking centre-halves for Diego Costa to score Chelseas late winner, had proved as much.", "id": "football/blog/2016/aug/23/cesc-fabregas-antonio-conte-chelsea", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "Yet there have been times this summer when those qualities actually appeared dispensable. F\u00e0bregas has been wondering where he might fit in since mid-April, when he was a studio guest on Skys Premier League coverage as the top flight digested the news that Conte was bound for south\u2011west London after Euro 2016. He had said then he might not be the all\u2011action midfielder who would fit the managers favoured profile. The 29\u2011year\u2011old does not charge around the pitch, closing down opponents or working feverishly to reclaim possession. His own game is not about blistering pace off the mark or any great mobility when working defensively, but relies instead on more subtle contributions, whether inventive or sly in the challenge.
