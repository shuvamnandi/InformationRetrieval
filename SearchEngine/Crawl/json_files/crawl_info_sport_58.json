It was exquisite fare for much of the evening and, when Andriy Shevchenko squeezed in his second goal of the night two minutes before half-time, seemed to be going precisely as the old master Valeriy Lobanovskiy had designed. Moments later Michael Tarnats daisycutter of a free-kick restored some doubt but Vitaliy Kosovskiys 50th-minute goal \u2013 capitalising on some sloppy defending \u2013 suggested Dynamo would cut loose. But this was an excellent Bayern side and they fought back with two goals in a frantic last 12 minutes.

This was a formidable Juventus side and the game appeared to be up, but Roy Keanes 24th-minute header quickly changed the complexion. Ten minutes later Dwight Yorke gave United an improbable away-goals lead from Andy Coles cross and, having held out commendably in the second half, they made it safe late on when Cole slotted into an empty net.
