He sounded genuinely apologetic about the disaster in France after the far from perfect win in Slovakia on Sunday, which must be welcomed. There is a long way to go until the scars have been healed but it is a start, he said. All we can do is win against whoever we have in front of us but I think there is a long way to go before we repay everyone for what happened in the Euros. Yet Dier also deserves praise for his performances. There is a growing argument that the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder has been Englands best player in 2016, doing much of the thankless dirty work that passes by unnoticed. And in Trnava on Sunday evening he was as dependable as usual. Nobody touched or passed the ball more and with plenty of questions over the composition of Sam Allardyces midfield in the future, Dier must be the only certain starter.
