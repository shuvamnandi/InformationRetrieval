And yet the England captaincy matters simply because a lot of people think it matters. Steven Gerrard was upset when it was taken off him by a caretaker manager, Stuart Pearce, and David Beckham was uplifted when it was given to him by a caretaker manager, Peter Taylor. The countrys latest caretaker manager, Gareth Southgate, should have de-fetishised the armband by announcing England do not need a captain other than for administrative purposes \u2013 to do the coin toss, basically \u2013 and, therefore, that the identity of the skipper for the matches against Malta, Slovenia and all opponents during his reign would be decided two seconds before each match by a dressing-room raffle.

The reality is that, if Scotland fail to win their home game against what is probably the second weakest team in Group F behind Malta, then they face an uphill task to reach Russia, even at this early stage in qualification. Scotlands 5-1 win in Malta flattered Strachans side \u2013 but for a miscued Robert Snodgrass cross that luckily found the net they would have gone in at half-time 1-0 down, and it was only a contentious penalty that reduced Malta to 10 men and gave Strachans side the space to dominate. Lithuania will be a tougher task but, with Slovakia, England and Slovenia to come, Scotland need as many points on the board as possible, something that Strachan should know from the failed Euro 2016 qualification campaign.
