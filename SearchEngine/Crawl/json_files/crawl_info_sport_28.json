He thinks some of his midfielders, namely Aaron Ramsey and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, benefit from being in a three and perhaps it is also designed to relieve some pressure on the struggling Granit Xhaka. Although he has had to change things around in both games (after Laurent Koscielnys red card against Bayern and Oxlade-Chamberlains hamstring strain against Lincoln) it is revealing that Wenger is trying something tactically new in a bid to save Arsenals season. It is, of course, a credit to Lincoln that he would play his strongest team, in its potentially most solid guise, against the non-league flagbearers.", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "type": "article", "webPublicationDate": "2017-03-13T08:59:28Z", "webTitle": "Premier League and FA Cup: talking points from the weekend\u2019s action", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/mar/13/premier-league-fa-cup-talking-points", "wordCnt": 1443}, {"apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/mar/13/sydney-fcs-underwhelming-crowds-should-be-cause-for-alarm", "firPara": "The A-League premiers-elect may not have been helped by scheduling or some inclement weather, but the low average is remarkably at odds with their success", "id": "football/2017/mar/13/sydney-fcs-underwhelming-crowds-should-be-cause-for-alarm", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "This A-League season has been one of unprecedented success for Sydney FC, with only one defeat so far and the Premiers Plate all but sewn up with four games to go.", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "type": "article", "webPublicationDate": "2017-03-13T01:30:31Z", "webTitle": "Sydney FC's underwhelming  crowds should be cause for alarm | Mike Ticher", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/13/sydney-fcs-underwhelming-crowds-should-be-cause-for-alarm", "wordCnt": 998}], "startIndex": 271, "status": "ok", "total": 141934, "userTier": "developer"}}
