Ive no idea, he said. Its my first proper season in the Premier League. I have no idea what to do to win the Premier League. Im pretty sure it was never decided at the end of October. We feel good in the moment, thats all. The notion that an experienced manager with 15 years on the job \u2013 who won the Bundesliga twice and has spent more than a year in England to immerse himself in its foibles \u2013 has no idea how to win the Premier League seems to be both endearing and a shrewd ploy. Playing it all down is a sensible approach, but will be difficult to sustain the longer Liverpool keep gathering results in their own inimitable fashion. It was an emotional game. Dejan Lovren felt such a maddening anger after his error led towards one of the Palace goals he admitted he wanted to leap into the crowd (where the Palace hardcore hang out, incidentally) when he scored. The home goalscorer, James McArthur, said he felt gutted at the end of it all. Dealing with emotional games is part of the ride under Klopp. Entertaining? Absolutely. But the manager also says the way they play is rational. We dont do it because we want to show something, we do it because it helps us, because the best kind of defending is keeping the ball, he explains. Its quite logical.
