England have still not won their first game at a European Championship, with this a wasteful draw given how dominant they had been. In the context of late frustration all the promise of the brighter play, offered up by Adam Lallana to Kyle Walker to Danny Rose, will have felt spoiled. In the end this was actually a result for Wales to cherish from afar. Russia are an ageing outfit who must take on the Welsh last. Chris Coleman will be licking his lips at the prospect of his team confronting them in Toulouse.

Yet, as he dictated his teams performance just as he had Manchester Uniteds in last months FA Cup final, there was logic to the tactic. There was space to exploit off Roman Neust\u00e4dter, who was technically German 12 days ago and looked out of his depth at times, with the England captain spraying passes, both short and long, at will as if offering up his very own impression of Paul Scholes. He even tracked back to intercept, particularly when Aleksandr Kokorin threatened to break, and his attacking instincts were never dulled as Igor Akinfeev could testify. There was no risk to be found here if he could see plenty of the ball.
