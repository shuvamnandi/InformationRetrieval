England had won convincingly and, though it may need a few more results of this nature before they are forgiven for the ordeal of Euro 2016, there was at least the sense of a team moving forward, with a little more optimism than before.

England could have passed the ball with more authority at times and Southgate is surely too perceptive to think the teams shortcomings have been removed on the basis of one evenings work. Equally it is difficult to be too critical after they have won by this margin and, if nothing else, it was certainly an improvement on the 2-0 home win against Malta and the 0-0 draw in Slovenia.
