Although United are unlikely to veer too far away from pragmatism \u2013 this is a Mourinho side, after all \u2013 it is reasonable to expect them to play with enhanced adventure, given that they are riding high after nine successive wins in all competitions, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring consistently, Paul Pogba beginning to excel in midfield, Marcus Rashford spreading panic in opposition defences, Henrikh Mkhitaryan creating and Juan Mata continuing to chip in with important goals. Victory would lift them two points behind J\u00fcrgen Klopps side, so this is no time for timidity.
