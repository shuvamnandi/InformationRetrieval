But footballers are creatures of extreme habit and Tottenham have found the transition from the tight and atmospheric confines of White Hart Lane to be jarring.

Tottenham have found it difficult to impose their pressing game on the bigger pitch. The clubs return of four points from their three Champions League away ties has represented a positive.
