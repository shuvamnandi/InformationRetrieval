But that doesnt mean it isnt nice when those who have given the game remarkable things are able to retire on a high. For the first time, it looks as though Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will leave Arsenal this summer, which ought to increase the already significant pressure on his players. No doubt, he is partly responsible for their inability to tolerate it, but in the end, it is them out there, not him, and they should be ashamed of their midweek behaviour, as they should of much of the last ten years. But now, they have an opportunity to partially redeem themselves; if they can lift the trophy, Arsenal will once again be the FA Cups most winningest team, with Wenger moving clear as the FA Cups most winningnest manager. Chances are, they will find a way past Sutton however badly they play, but this tie is not solely about that; they must also begin healing and atoning their thrashing in Munich. If they can play close to their potential, then they will be in a better position for when the games get harder. Arsenals players must remind themselves that it is because of Wenger that they have the privilege of playing for Arsenal, and because of Wenger that they are quite as rich as they are. Its about time they shook the self-consciousness and let it all hang out, if not for themselves, to do all they can for someone they owe a proper send-off.
