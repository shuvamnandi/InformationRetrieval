His players were going through a training exercise featuring two sets of players in one penalty area. On one side, Hodgson was rotating groups of four or five attackers. On the other, outnumbered, Gary Cahill and John Stones were trying to keep them out with Joe Hart in goal. And Hodgson did not sound too enamoured by the number of times the various attacking manoeuvres came to nothing. The quality at the moment has to be better than this, Hodgson, halting play, could be heard shouting to his players.", "id": "football/2016/jun/23/roy-hodgson-england-not-underestimate-iceland", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "It might have to be in Nice as well if the game against Iceland on Monday is not to take a place fairly high up on the list of Englands more chastening experiences. England, to use Wayne Rooneys description, will be overwhelming favourites in the Allianz Riviera and it is worth noting the reaction of the five-man Football Association delegation who watched Lars Lagerbacks team play Austria at Parc des Princes on Wednesday. Hodgsons entourage were visibly pleased when Arnor Ingvi Traustason scored the goal that meant England will face the smallest nation in the tournament. However diplomatic Hodgson and his staff might be over the coming days, there can be no doubt they are relieved to have avoided Portugal and a renascent Cristiano Ronaldo when Iceland, to put it one way, have a centre-half whose career incorporates spells at Plymouth Argyle and Rotherham United.", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "type": "article", "webPublicationDate": "2016-06-23T23:18:18Z", "webTitle": "Roy Hodgson and England vow not to underestimate \u2018throwback\u2019 Iceland", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/23/roy-hodgson-england-not-underestimate-iceland", "wordCnt": 1189}, {"apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2016/jun/23/juanfran-overconfidence-spain-croatia-euro-2016", "firPara": "Juanfran admits overconfidence cost Spain their place at the top of Group\u00a0D, leaving them in a position where they may have to overcome Italy, Germany and France if they are to reach the final of Euro 2016.
