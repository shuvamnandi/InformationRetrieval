True, the former Leicester midfielder and current MEP Theo Zagorakis was fifth on Fifas list 12 years later, having been named the official player of the tournament in Portugal, but he was an unlikely hero (his performances earned him a move to Bologna in Serie A, where the owner, Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara, welcomed him as our Greek Baggio, our Aegean Baggino; within a year they had been relegated, and Zagorakis had been released) and Greece had never previously won a game at a major international competition. The target was to win a game, said the midfielder Vasilis Tsiartas. Just one game. That would have counted as a success winning just once. The Observer predicted they would fail to get out of the group, however the heat could mean they pick up a point against Russia; in the end Russia were the only team they lost to. They beat the hosts in the opening game, squeezed into the knockout rounds after Portugal beat Spain in the final group match and then plotted a low-scoring path to glory, with France, the Czech Republic (after extra time) and Portugal again in the final all beaten 1-0.

Led by Jocelyn Angloma, a member of Frances squad at Euro 92 and Euro 96 who had settled into semi-retirement in his homeland with Etoile de Morne-\u00e0-lEau and turned 42 six weeks after the tournament (the former Manchester City and Sheffield United centre-back David Sommeil and the future Swindon and Cardiff defender Miguel Comminges were also in the squad), Guadeloupe opened their first ever Gold Cup with a 1-1 draw against Haiti, before shocking Canada in their second game, Angloma scoring with a 35-yard lob-volley to set the team on their way to a 2-1 win. Angloma again \u2013 who made his name as a full-back but played for Guadeloupe on the wing \u2013 scored the opening goal in a 2-1 quarter-final win over Honduras, who would qualify for the next World Cup. Mexico stood between the Gwada Boys and a fairytale final, but though they clung on until deep into the second half this was a step too far, and they lost 1-0. We wanted teams to stand up and recognise Guadeloupean football, said Roger Salnot, their coach. Guadeloupe is an island of 400,000 people whereas Mexico is powerful and has millions and millions.
