One of the greatest shocks - one of the greatest matches - in the entire history of the oldest major competition in world football! Lincoln City have become the first non-league side to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup since Queens Park Rangers managed it in 1914. (That was the year Burnley lifted the trophy, a lovely additional historical quirk.) Their victory was hugely deserved; the Imps were magnificent from front to back. Burnley werent at their best, but they simply werent allowed to be, as the comical rolling spat between an irate Joey Barton and the uncowed Matt Rhead illustrated. So Lincolns hero, the goalscorer Sean Raggett, has become an instant FA Cup legend, not least because of that post-match interview. No time for celebrations, its North Ferriby on Tuesday.
