There may be a more recent example of strong and well-coordinated defending by Liverpool players but none spring to mind. There is definitely no more recent example of Tottenham winning at Anfield their 2-0 victory in 2011 was their first in 18 years and they have not repeated it since. Indeed this season, for all their undoubted progress, they have yet to win away to any of the top six, losing at Chelsea and Manchester United and drawing at Manchester City and Arsenal. This is their last major away trip of the season (although Aprils visit to Burnley will be no picnic) and a victory would fuel belief that Mauricio Pochettino is turning Tottenham into a truly formidable outfit. J\u00fcrgen Klopp, meanwhile, needs his players to produce a performance that will renew faith in him. A match in which both teams are committed to chasing victory could suit both sides and thrill onlookers.
