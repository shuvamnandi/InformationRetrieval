It might be a bit of a stretch to call Daniel Sturridge Liverpools best player, but hes certainly their best striker, and the most natural finisher they have. If he could keep himself fit for long enough, hed easily be a 20 goals a season man, but Liverpool have such an exceptional front four at the moment that he \u2013 or indeed any traditional centre-forward \u2013 is not required. Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Adam Lallana are doing very nicely indeed without him. Sturridge popped up and scored twice against Tottenham in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, at least reminding J\u00fcrgen Klopp that he remains a very good striker indeed. Ive never been in doubt about him, said Klopp, but will the kind words translate to a place in the team? One wonders if its more frustrating or less for Sturridge that he is not in Klopps first-choice team, but really due to no fault of his own.
