Against opposition from the Big Six, Chelsea have dropped 11 points in this campaign compared with Arsenals 10 and yet the chasm between both clubs currently stands at nine points due to Arsenals carelessness in the face of teams such as Watford, Bournemouth, Middlesbrough, this seasons incarnation of Leicester City and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 Everton. By contrast, the only team outside the top six to take points from Chelsea have been Swansea. Following their midweek pratfall at the Emirates against a Watford side that had failed to win any of their previous seven league games, many will be expecting a reaction from an Arsenal side whose emphatic win over Chelsea in September prompted Antonio Conte to switch to the formation that has served him so well ever since. We may well get one, but it is unlikely to make any difference to Arsenals increasingly forlorn looking title tilt. Given Arsenals obvious collective frailties, they look the most poorly equipped of the chasing pack to take advantage in the very unlikely event of Chelsea performing a Devon Loch.
