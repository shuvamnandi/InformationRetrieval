This, surely, is the moment when footballers should be at their physical peak, following a few weeks rest and a few further weeks of controlled muscle-buffing and tactic-honing. And yet, here we are. Per Mertesacker, injured in a friendly against Lens, and Gabriel Paulista, who failed to finish a warm-up game against Manchester City, will both be missing for a couple of months, and with Laurent Koscielny only just having returned from an extended post-European Championship summer break the only fully fit defenders are Calum Chambers \u2013 who has played 51 minutes of league football in 2016, across four games \u2013 and Rob Holding, a 20-year-old, \u00a32m summer signing from Bolton Wanderers. The veracity of Francis Coquelins boast during pre-season that he had been playing centre-back and bossing it in training could get a very early test. This fixture has been pretty reliably entertaining for a while now \u2013 the goalless draw here last August was the first in 43 meetings between these sides, in which time there have been two 4-2s, a 4-0, a 4-1, a 4-4 and a 6-3 \u2013 and with Liverpools attack strengthened over the summer another stalemate would appear unlikely.
