Not long into a dark winding journey it became clear these werent everyday fans, but a small group of what appeared to be ageing faces, grizzly old semi-retired hoolie types, a bit wasted, out on the town, talking about pawdah and brasses, showing off and being self-consciously rowdy but still a bit disturbing on a dark night on the outskirts of the jungle.", "id": "football/blog/2017/mar/23/england-football-away-trips-germany-fans", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "In the middle of which, as scheduled, James Richardson from the Guardians award-winning football podcast phoned for a chat about Englands chances at the Arena Amaz\u00f4nia, a conversation that took place against a back drop of Mal and Gav and Dave shouting Fack off, you slag, This blokes a ponce, give me the phone mate, and so on while playfully rabbit-punching me with enormous concrete fists. Through this your correspondent continued to talk in measured tones about tactics and formations and the chance of seeing Raheem Sterling in the No10 role, a kind of Partridge meets the Sex Pistols scenario.
