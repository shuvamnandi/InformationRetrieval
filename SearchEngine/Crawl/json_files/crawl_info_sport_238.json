Before a match a player is asked what their hopes are for the challenge ahead. Their answer invariably has them looking forward to the game while perhaps including a little deflection when steered towards a subject that could lead to controversy. In post-match interviews players are asked how they feel about the result and perhaps something they did in the match. Through lack of time, fatigue or media training, we often learn little beyond what emotion a player is experiencing at that moment. This is often no fault of the footballer or even the interviewer. Thoughtfulness is not encouraged in football.
