It was March 2014 and on a strange afternoon at Stamford Bridge, Andre Marriner sent off Kieran Gibbs in a case of mistaken identity, as Jos\u00e9 Mourinhos side hit their visitors for six without reply. Arsenal had already lost 6-3 at Manchester City and 5-1 at Liverpool that season, capitulations that rendered Wengers team and any aspirations they had towards a title win a laughing stock. With apologies to Leicester fans, this is the second big test of Arsenals credentials as potential title winners in six games. They have already failed the first, against Liverpool. Should they fail this one, against likely fellow contenders for a top four spot, the weekend airwaves will echo to the sound of seething Gooners repeating their forlorn and familiar lament that its once again time for Wenger to go.
