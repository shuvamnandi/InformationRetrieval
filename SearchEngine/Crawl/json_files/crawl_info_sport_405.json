He and his musical partner, Johnny Spurling, had written a song about the newish England manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson, which had received some airplay on TalkSport before the pair went abroad in late August. We went to Spain to do some gigs and when we got back, suddenly everyones on the phone, Bell says. It never stopped ringing. We did some interviews on the Friday, then the match was on the Saturday. It was all geared up if we beat Germany the Sven song was going to go through the roof.", "id": "football/2016/sep/01/germany-1-5-england-15-years-on-world-cup-qualifier-sven-goran-eriksson", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "On the Saturday night they played a corporate event in Essex. We did the first set and people already knew the song because it had been on the radio that week. Then we had a break and everyone stopped to watch the game. It was an amazing night, he says. When Gerrard scored I remember me and Johnny diving across the floor like J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann. We did a second set and ended up doing four encores of Sven at this corporate gig. It was hilarious. The next day Capital Radio put out a version with Jonathan Pearces match commentary mixed in and it was everywhere. On the Monday we had seven major labels all bidding for us. It was just a mental time. There was this Svenmania. Its only a football song but it captured a moment.
