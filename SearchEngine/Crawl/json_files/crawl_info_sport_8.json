It is thumbs up on that front for now and there is circumstantial evidence of progress beyond that. After an honourable defeat by an improvised Germany team, England showed against Lithuania just enough speed and clever movement to unhinge opponents who aspired to do nothing more than erect human barricades around their box from the first minute. Both goals were beauties but there were also bouts of familiar stodginess. At least Southgate has made some bold selections, defetishised the captaincy and suggested he is a man with a plan and the strength and clarity of thought to implement it. The true tests lie ahead but Southgate has made a fair start.", "id": "football/blog/2017/mar/26/five-talking-points-england-lithuania-world-cup-2018-qualifier", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "The bar for measuring the performance of Englands fans also starts low. At Wembley there were, at least, no war chants or loutish nonsense and silence prevailed throughout the Lithuanian national anthem, which was followed by respectful applause from the hosts. The minutes silence in memory of the victims of the Westminster attacks was also observed with decorum, as was the tribute to the late Graham Taylor. Once the game got going the mood in the ground was fun. The visit of the team ranked 107 in the world for a seemingly foregone conclusion of a match did not quite draw a full house but an attendance of 77,690 seemingly good-humoured people was still a fine turnout. The sight of Jermain Defoe leading out the team with five-year-old Bradley Lowery was also lovely.
