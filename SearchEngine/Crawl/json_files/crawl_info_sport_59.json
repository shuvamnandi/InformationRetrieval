In the Champions League knockout stages it was 522 minutes without a goal at kick-off. To compound his problems, Ag\u00fceros first sight of the Monaco goal resulted in huge controversy when he was booked for a perceived dive over Subasic when a red card and penalty could easily have been the outcome. A weak-minded forward might have retreated into his shell.
