Pep Guardiolas 100th match in European competition ends in failure; its the first time hes crashed out at this stage of the Champions League. City had chances to get themselves out of trouble in that second half, but passed too many up. For six minutes, it looked like Leroy Sane had saved them, but Tiemoue Bakayokos header put Monaco through. On balance, the French league leaders deserve to scrape through this high-scoring tie on away goals; they were always effervescent in attack, and tonights first half was the one big difference in an otherwise tight ding-dong battle over two legs.

But the memory that will linger of these two matches will not be that rat-a-tat of goals in the last 20 minutes at the Etihad but the manner in which the visitors were overwhelmed in the opening period of the return.
