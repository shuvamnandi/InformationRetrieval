Barkley was one of the notable absentees when Sam Allardyce named his one and only squad as the national team manager. Roy Hodgson did not give him a single minute in Euro 2016 and Barkley was one of only two outfield players, the other being Nathaniel Clyne, not to feature during Englands 1-0 defeat against Germany and the 2-0 win over Lithuania. Southgate felt compelled to have a long discussion with Barkley on Saturday and praised him for his improved performances at Everton, having previously left him out during his four-game period in interim charge towards the end of last year. Yet Barkley is entitled to be frustrated when he has not started an England game for a year and managed the grand total of zero minutes from his last seven call-ups. Southgate had kind words to say about him after the latest international break but he is also the third England manager in a row who has not fully trusted Barkley \u2013 not yet, anyway \u2013 and, for all his undoubted talent, the midfielder should probably acknowledge they cannot all be mistaken.
