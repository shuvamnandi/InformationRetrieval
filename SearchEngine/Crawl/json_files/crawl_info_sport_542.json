Jack Wilshere was alone and in space, his instincts surely screaming at him that his moment had come. A year ago he might have collected on his chest and spat away a volley to test Matus Kozacik, or even taken another touch to leave the defenders on their heels. This is a midfielder who knows he can conjure moments of such brilliance.", "id": "football/2016/jun/20/jack-wilshere-england-slovakia", "isHosted": false, "secPara": "Yet, in the context of recent toils, the rather limp reverse pass he did muster, aimed vaguely at Daniel Sturridge to his side, was revealing. Tomas Hubocan anticipated the delivery, darted in and smuggled the ball away, leaving Wilshere, head briefly bowed, turning to begin the retreat back downfield. Occasions like this, when a player of such scintillating natural ability is striving for form having battled so long for fitness, can seem horribly cruel. Back when England were forging clear at the top of their qualifying group, Wilshere was one of those who set them apart. Yet this was a painful reminder that 141 minutes of club football over an entire campaign is no preparation for a major international tournament.", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "type": "article", "webPublicationDate": "2016-06-20T22:28:01Z", "webTitle": "Jack Wilshere pays the price for a season on the sidelines", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/20/jack-wilshere-england-slovakia", "wordCnt": 907}, {"apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2016/jun/20/slovakia-england-euro-2016-player-ratings-roy-hodgson", "firPara": "Would have been keen for a drama-free match after his error against Wales, and got that until Chris Smallings aberration.
